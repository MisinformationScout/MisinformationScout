<b class="text"> <p>If at first you may be confused, let me first tell you the definition of a bot or socialbot in specifics. A bot, in regards to social media, is “a software program that stimulates human behavior in automated reactions on social network sites” (Rouse, M). These programs are built to resemble a real person by using AI (artificial intelligence) and tools such as text mining and databases of general recent information to help more easily deceive individuals online. If it wasn’t bad enough that you had to brood about whether or not the person you are talking to on the other side of the screen was who they say they are, now you have to worry whether or not they actually exist.</p> 

	<p>The AI isn’t the end of it however, as bots are also programmed to act human as well. They may not always post at regular intervals and can be somewhat sporadic in this regard. Also they may follow a “sleep pattern” wherein they do not post anything at all to make the account more believable as a person. Bots will be created with a specific goal in mind, whether that be to market things or more popularly influence political/social campaigns.</p>

	<p>If you’re just hearing about these it would be surprising to say the least and it would not be because they are a relatively new concept. Bots or machinery that could theoretically communicate and possible empathize with human beings have been ever-present in robotics and media for a plethora of years dating back to chatbots that existed for this very purpose and the famous Terminator series that came out in the early 80’s. The problem however is how they have evolved, coming from a innocent and ambitious campaign to create artificial companions, to being annoying and sometimes malicious fake info spreaders and behavior alterers. One such example being the aftermath of the Boston marathon bombing wherein a number of bots perpetuated false accusations and spread such fake information all across the site through the use of liking and retweeting. Their algorithms were not checking the validity of their sources and this is what led to the situation.  Not all, but absolutely the majority can be described as malicious or benign. A big example that pops into everyone’s minds would be the 2016 presidential election in the United States. Bots were a huge part of this election in particular by spreading misinformation and linking “evidence” which actually turned out to be non credible websites and launching all out smear campaigns. According to Alessandro Bessi and Emilio Ferrara nearly 20% of political conversation were tweets from believed social bots with an estimated 400,000 accounts that were bots. These accounts were discovered by their own “advanced machine learning techniques.</p>

	<p>Techniques to find such bots for yourself can be used and should be known to any user on social media. Here's a list of small similarities that bots share: most have a cartoon character as their profile avatar as having an actual human would be identity fraud and therefore illegal, most bots will follow a huge number of accounts but have only a few followers themselves in return, they will usually lack empathy in their posts as they are incapable of showing it being bots and all, and finally they will have unusual usernames often being too long or short with many numbers/ symbols.</p> 

	<p>There’s also other means of detecting social bots, and that is to use programs for the specific purpose of finding them. Botometer, is a web service developed at Indiana University that allows users to access Twitter's API to find bots which only requires signing in. However, you must allow access to operations on your account such as tweeting, access to followers, etc. There are other web services alike but share the disadvantage of having to sign in with an account to use the program. With the AMS (Anti-Misinformation-Scout) we hope to create a program capable of telling whether a specific account is a bot without the help of the Twitter API, therefore mitigating the need to log in.</p>
